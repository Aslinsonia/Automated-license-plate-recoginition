🚗 Automated License Plate Recognition

This project performs **Automated License Plate Recognition (ALPR)** using OpenCV, NumPy, and Tesseract OCR. It detects the license plate region from a car image and attempts to extract the plate text.

---
 📌 Features

- Detects license plates from car images
- Uses edge detection and contour approximation
- Applies Optical Character Recognition (OCR) with `pytesseract`
- Colab-compatible with `cv2_imshow`

---

🛠️ Requirements

Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install opencv-python-headless numpy pytesseract
Note: We use opencv-python-headless instead of opencv-python to avoid display issues in headless environments like Google Colab.
